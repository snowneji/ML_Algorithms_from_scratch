# DeepLearning Learning Scripts

 - **tf_MNIST.py**: ConvNet on MNIST data using Tensorflow.
 - **SuperLearner.R**: Building a neural network super learner for breast cancer prediction  by ensembling logistic regression, random forest and naive bayes to improve accuracy



### The best way to learn is to code from scratch =)
